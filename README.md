The purpose of this assignment was to create a web form using HTML, CSS, and GitHub. I created
a web form that collects data about the undergraduate student lifestyle. 

My web form conforms to best practices for many reasons. First, it is essential to use clear and simple language when creating questions for the form. My web form incorporated easy to understand questions and did not use technical words that the average undergraduate student may not be familiar with.

Next, the questions should be arranged in a logical order to make it easy for the student to understand and complete the form. My form started with general information and then moved on to a new page with questions about various aspects of the student's lifestyle. Once submitted, the form clerly tells you that the repsonse has been recorded and you are all set. 

Lastly, the form should be easy to navigate. My web form is very easy to navigate back and forth through the survey. Students have a great undersatnding of how to navigate the form. There are clear 'next page' and 'back' buttons to help students navigate the form. In addition, the form includes page numbers at the bottom to clearly indicate which page you are on.
